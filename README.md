Luther College Data Science Senior Project

# 1. Introduction
The project uses the free API from [Alpha Vintage](https://www.alphavantage.co) to the weekly stock market price historical data in the past 20 years.

Additionally, Alpha Vintage also provides the STOCH index data. By definition, stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its price over a period of time. Moreover, Alpha Vantage APIs also allow us to retrieve a wide number of other technical indicators, such as simple moving average (SMA), weighted average price (VWAP), etc. I expect to use these technical indicators to improve the accuracy of our prediction.
